# Oops/Sl@ckers
## Week12, Research
### Pavel Danek

Hello team,
I have to apologize upfront, because I've been sick, so I'm trying to catch up on all the research!

I went thoroughly through [netboot.xyz](https://netboot.xyz) and [iPXE](https://ipxe.org/start) website,
but some parts are still unclear to me. I think that a brief brainstorming on Wed afternoon (before class, 4PM) would really be useful.

I tried to burn the **netboot.xyz.iso** image on my USB and run it. Here's what I've got:

![Pic #2 - Failsafe Menu (after hitting "m")](/Pics/IMG_7870.JPG)

As far as future setup of TFTP server, I think I found a useful article [here](https://dynamicparallax.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/how-to-setup-raspberry-pi-as-a-tftp-server/). Check it out.

See you soon!

-Pavel.
